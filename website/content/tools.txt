title: Tools using Liquidsoap

Here are some tools which are using Liquidsoap in order to provide interfaces,
schedulers or web integration. Feel free to
"contact us":"mailto:savonet-users@lists.sf.net" if you are aware of some more!

* "Airtime":http://www.sourcefabric.org/en/airtime/ lets you take total control of your radio station via the web with intelligent archive management, powerful search, an easy playlist builder, a simple scheduling calendar and rock-solid automated playout. Those who need a little extra will love the ability to manage staff, record and rebroadcast a live show, upload to SoundCloud automatically, stream to Icecast and display programme information via Airtime's website widgets.
* "Shampoo":http://java.net/projects/shampoo/pages/Home is an all-in-one web platform that allows you to create, manage, and deliver to streaming servers and listeners your own webradios and radio shows.
* "FileScheduler":http://wiki.tryphon.eu/filescheduler/start selects in your contents the best next one. No complex interface, no configuration file, simply files and directories.
* "Robinet":http://sourceforge.net/projects/robinet-lq/ is a GUI based on Liquidsoap to send a stream to multiple servers.
* "Baignoire":http://firedrake.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=baignoire.git is a lightweight web interface designed mainly with the "home/party" use-case in mind: a single player and multiple control clients. Clients can request individual tracks or playlists, and suitably-tagged playlists can go into a secondary queue for background play when explicit requests are exhausted.
