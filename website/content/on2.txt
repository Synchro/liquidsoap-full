h3. Liquidsoap Workshop

The workshop will be help on Thursday, from 11am to 2pm or more.
Everybody is welcome, beginners, advanced users and prospective contributors.

You are expected to bring your laptop for the workshop.
If possible, get the latest beta release of liquidsoap 1.0.0,
or at least a functioning liquidsoap.
But we can also help you to build and install it.

Below is a list of topics that we will cover, proposing problems,
guiding you through solving them and
discussing various solutions.

**1. Getting started**:
Get to know liquidsoap, playing with audio streams to get used
to the main concepts in liquidsoap.
Learn to run liquidsoap is various modes, from one-liners to daemon.

**2. Typical netradio examples**:
We will go through typical needs for netradios, covering transitions,
complex playlists, live show handling, blank detection, metadata handling,
etc.

**3. Beyond audio**:
For those who are interested, we can go through more advanced examples
exploring the possibilities of video and midi support in liquidsoap.

You are very welcome to ask for other things, but please
