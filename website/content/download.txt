title: Download and install liquidsoap


h2. Installing Savonet/Liquidsoap

There are several ways to install liquidsoap, either compiled from source, or using a package available for your distribution.

h3. Installing from source

You can download source code published by Savonet in our "sourceforge download section":http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=89802.

The recommended way for newcomers is to use the liquidsoap-full-xxx.tar.gz tarball. This tarball includes all required OCaml bindings and allows you to compile and install liquidsoap in a single @configure@, @make@ and @make install@ procedure. You will still need the corresponding C libraries and their developement files, though.

You will then have to "build the source":doc-svn/build.html.

h3. Debian/Ubuntu packages

Liquidsoap is included in Debian and Ubuntu distributions:

* "Debian packages":http://packages.debian.org/liquidsoap
* "Ubuntu packages":http://packages.ubuntu.com/liquidsoap

Starting with package version @1.0.0~beta2.1-3@, official Debian and Ubuntu packages can dynamically
load the MP3 and AAC+ encoders without the need to recompile the software to enable these features!

In order to activate them, you can either compile and install @ocaml-lame@ and @ocamlaacplus@ or, more simply, 
install the @liblame-ocaml-dynlink@ and @libaacplus-ocaml-dynlink@ packages available from 
"Debian Multimedia":http://debian-multimedia.org/.

We also maintain custom packages for liquidsoap:

* "Daily Debian packages":debian_daily.html

**Disclaimer: custom packages are currently outdated. We are looking for constributors to help bringing them back!**

The daily packages are mostly aimed toward developers.

h3. ArchLinux

A package for Arch Linux users is available from the distribution,
see the "ArchLinux Liquidsoap package page":http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=23902

h3. Native Windows Binary.

A native windows binary is available in our download section. See
"this page":windows.html for more information concerning this port
and how it is built.

h3. Cygwin (Windows)

Liquidsoap is available as a Cygwin port, thanks to the Cywin Ports project ! You can get instructions
on how to install Cygwin ports on their website: "http://sourceware.org/cygwinports/":http://sourceware.org/cygwinports/.

This port allows you to compile a liquidsoap binary running on windows systems and using the (great) Cygwin unix
environement for windows.

h3. Mac OS X

You can download and build liquidsoap using either
* "Homebrew":homebrew.html.
* "MacPorts":macports.html (not really supported at the moment).

h3. FreeBSD

Liquidsoap is "available":http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/ports/audio/liquidsoap/ in FreeBSD using the port system.

h3. Mercurial reporsitory (and other distributions)

If you want a cutting-edge version, you can use the mercurial (HG) repository.
To get a copy of it, just run:

<pre>
hg clone http://savonet.hg.sourceforge.net:8000/hgroot/savonet/savonet
</pre>

After that, you can synchronize your repository using @hg pull ; hg update@.
Once you have an up-to-date working copy,
start with a @./bootstrap@ and follow the usual
"build instructions":doc-svn/build.html.
