Notes for releasing the liquidsoap-full tarballs:
 * Do NOT include PACKAGES
 * The only toplevel files should be:
     bootstrap, configure, Makefile
     PACKAGES.default, PACKAGES.minimal
     README, LICENSE, INSTALL
 * All of the above files are version independent, no version
   number is hardcoded there
 * Run make clean before creating the tarball. Since there is no PACKAGES, use
     for i in ocaml-* liquidsoap* ; do make -C $i clean ; done
