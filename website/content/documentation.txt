h2. Savonet documentation

h3. Help by users for users

Besides the official documentation (see below),
some user-made documentation is being aggregated and organized
"on the sourcefabric wiki":http://wiki.sourcefabric.org/display/LS/User+Snippets
(for now).
It should become a great place where people help each other, explain problems 
and solutions in their own words. Please contribute!
