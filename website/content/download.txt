title: Download and install liquidsoap


h2. Installing Savonet/Liquidsoap

There are several ways to install liquidsoap, either compiled from source, or using a package available for your distribution.

h3. Installing from source

You can download source code published by Savonet in our "sourceforge download section":http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=89802.

The recommended way for newcomers is to use the liquidsoap-full-xxx.tar.gz tarball. This tarball includes all required OCaml bindings and allows you to compile and install liquidsoap in a single @configure@, @make@ and @make install@ procedure. You will still need the corresponding C libraries and their developement files, though.

You will then have to "build the source":doc-svn/build.html.

h3. Debian/Ubuntu packages

Liquidsoap is included in Debian and Ubuntu distributions:

* "Debian packages":http://packages.debian.org/liquidsoap
* "Ubuntu packages":http://packages.ubuntu.com/liquidsoap

However, we maintain custom packages for liquidsoap, in order to enable features that are not available in those distributions, such as mp3 encoding:

* "Daily Debian packages":debian_daily.html

The daily packages are mostly aimed toward developers.

h3. ArchLinux

A package for Arch Linux users is available from the distribution,
see the "ArchLinux Liquidsoap package page":http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=23902

h3. Cygwin (Windows)

Liquidsoap is available as a Cygwin port, thanks to the Cywin Ports project ! You can get instructions
on how to install Cygwin ports on their website: "http://sourceware.org/cygwinports/":http://sourceware.org/cygwinports/.

This port allows you to compile a liquidsoap binary running on windows systems and using the (great) Cygwin unix
environement for windows.

h3. Mac OS X

You can download and build liquidsoap using either
* "Homebrew":homebrew.html.
* "MacPorts":macports.html (not really supported at the moment).

h3. FreeBSD

Liquidsoap is "available":http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/ports/audio/liquidsoap/ in FreeBSD using the port system.

h3. Subversion repository (and other distributions)

If you want a cutting-edge version, you can use the subversion repository. To
get a copy of it, just run:

<pre>
svn co https://savonet.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/savonet/trunk savonet
</pre>

You need then to bootstrap the configuration scripts:

<pre>./bootstrap</pre>

And then follow the "build instructions":doc-svn/build.html.

h3. Mercurial reporsitory

We are starting to use mercurial for our main repository because it offers more
features than subversion. We should sync the subversion repository with the
mercurial one from time to time, but if you really want cutting edge version of
Liquidsoap this is the way to go. To get a copy of it, simply run

<pre>
hg clone http://savonet.hg.sourceforge.net:8000/hgroot/savonet/savonet
</pre>

and afterwards follow the "build instructions":doc-svn/build.html.

If you are not familiar with mercurial, we recall that the repository can be
updated using

<pre>
hg pull; hg up
</pre>
