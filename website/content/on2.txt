Everybody is welcome, beginners, advanced users and prospective contributors.
This will be a unique opportunity for you to learn from the devs,
and for us to get immediate feedback from users.

You are expected to **bring your laptop**.
If possible, get the **latest beta** release of liquidsoap 1.0.0,
or at least a functioning liquidsoap.
But we can also help you to build and install it.

guiding you through solving them and
discussing various solutions.

**1. Getting started**:
Get to know liquidsoap, playing with audio streams to get used
