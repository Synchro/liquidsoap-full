title: Download and install liquidsoap


h2. Installing Savonet/Liquidsoap

There are several ways to install liquidsoap, either compiled from source, or using a package available for your distribution.

h3. Installing from source

You can download source code published by Savonet in our "sourceforge download section":http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=89802.

The recommended way for newcomers is to use the liquidsoap-full-xxx.tar.gz tarball. This tarball includes all required OCaml bindings and allows you to compile and install liquidsoap in a single @configure@, @make@ and @make install@ procedure. You will still need the corresponding C libraries and their developement files, though.

You will then have to "build the source":doc-svn/build.html.

h3. Debian/Ubuntu packages

Liquidsoap is included in Debian and Ubuntu distributions:

* "Debian packages":http://packages.debian.org/liquidsoap
* "Ubuntu packages":http://packages.ubuntu.com/liquidsoap

However, we maintain custom packages for liquidsoap, in order to enable features that are not available in those distributions, such as mp3 encoding:

* "Debian stable packages":http://savonet.rastageeks.org/wiki/DebianStableBackports
* "Daily Debian packages":http://savonet.rastageeks.org/wiki/DebianSVNSnapshots

The daily packages are mostly aimed toward developers.

h3. Mac OS X

You can download and build liquidsoap using "macports":http://www.macports.org/. See the "instructions":macports.html.

h3. Subversion repository (and other distributions)

If you want a cutting-edge version, you can use the subversion repository. To get a copy of it, just run:

<pre>
svn co \
 https://savonet.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/savonet/trunk \
 savonet
</pre>

You need then to bootstrap the configuration scripts:

<pre>./bootstrap</pre>

And then follow the "build instructions":doc-svn/build.html.
