title: Download and install liquidsoap


h2. Installing Savonet/Liquidsoap

There are several ways to install liquidsoap, either compiled from source, or using a package available for your distribution.

* "From source":#source
* "Debian/Ubuntu":#deb
* "Windows":#win32
* "Mac OS X":#osx
* "FreeBSD":#freebsd
* "Cygwin (windows)":#cygwin
* "ArchLinux":#arch
* "Latest development version":#hg

h3@source. Installing from source

You can download source code published by Savonet in our "sourceforge download section":http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=89802.

The recommended way for newcomers is to use the liquidsoap-full-xxx.tar.gz tarball. This tarball includes all required OCaml bindings and allows you to compile and install liquidsoap in a single @configure@, @make@ and @make install@ procedure. You will still need the corresponding C libraries and their development files, though.

You will then have to "build the source":doc-svn/build.html.

h3@deb. Debian/Ubuntu packages

Liquidsoap is included in Debian and Ubuntu distributions:

* "Debian packages":http://packages.debian.org/liquidsoap
* "Ubuntu packages":http://packages.ubuntu.com/liquidsoap

Starting with package version @1.0.0~beta3-1@, official Debian and Ubuntu packages support MP3 encoding
by installing the optional @liquidsoap-plugin-lame@ package. These packages can also dynamically
load the AAC+ encoders without the need to recompile!

In order to activate the AAC+ encoder, you can either compile and install @ocaml-aacplus@ or, more simply, 
install the @libaacplus-ocaml-dynlink@ package available from 
"Debian Multimedia":http://debian-multimedia.org/.

We also maintain custom packages for liquidsoap:

* "Daily Debian packages":debian_daily.html

**Disclaimer: custom packages are currently outdated. We are looking for contributors to help bringing them back!**

The daily packages are mostly aimed toward developers.

h3@win32. Windows

A native windows binary is available in our "sourceforge download section":http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=89802. See
"this page":windows.html for more information concerning this port
and how it is built.

h3@osx. Mac OS X

You can download and build liquidsoap using "Homebrew":homebrew.html.

h3@freebsd. FreeBSD

Liquidsoap is "available":http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/ports/audio/liquidsoap/ in FreeBSD using the port system.

h3@cygwin. Cygwin (Windows)

Liquidsoap is available as a Cygwin port, thanks to the Cywin Ports project ! You can get instructions
on how to install Cygwin ports on their website: "http://sourceware.org/cygwinports/":http://sourceware.org/cygwinports/.

This port allows you to compile a liquidsoap binary running on windows systems and using the (great) Cygwin unix
environment for windows.

h3@arch. ArchLinux

A package for Arch Linux users is available from the distribution,
see the "ArchLinux Liquidsoap package page":http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=23902

h3@hg. Git repository (and other distributions)

If you want a cutting-edge version, you can use the git repository.
To get a copy of it, you have to run:

<pre>
git clone https://github.com/savonet/liquidsoap-full.git liquidsoap
cd liquidsoap
make init
</pre>

After, that you have to create a list of modules that you want to compile. A
good starting point is to do

<pre>
cp PACKAGES.minimal PACKAGES
</pre>

and edit the @PACKAGES@ file to uncomment the libraries you are interested in.
You should then run the configuration scripts by

<pre>
./bootstrap
./configure
</pre>

and finally build Liquidsoap:

<pre>
make
</pre>

After that, you should synchronize the repository from time to time using

<pre>
make update
</pre>

Some more explanations can be found in the "build instructions":doc-svn/build.html.
