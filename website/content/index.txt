h3. Liquidsoap

Our flagship is liquidsoap, a multimedia stream toolkit,
notably suited for netradios.
It has tons of features, it's free _and_ it's open-source!
Liquidsoap lets you to describe your streams in a powerful and flexible way.
Allowing arbitrarily deep-nested composition of streams,
it gives you more power than you need for creating an original netradio.
But liquidsoap is still very light and easy to use,
in the Unix tradition of simple strong components working together.
